WARNING
This "lithium" version of the netinstall script is not yet ready for release.
Do NOT use it for anything other than testing.
--------------------------------------------------------
This is a collection of files intended to install
a close approximation of the BunsenLabs Linux
on a basic command-line-only Debian Stretch system.

Bug reports are very welcome!
Please visit the bunsenlabs forums:

HOW TO USE

Download a Debian Buster "netinst" .iso file from here:
https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/
and use it to install a basic cli system.
(See "DEBIAN NETINSTALL HINTS" below.)

Boot into your Debian Netinstall Buster cli system,
log in and run these commands, as a normal user:
(A fresh copy of this bunsen-netinstall package will be downloaded.)

wget https://github.com/bunsenlabs/bunsen-netinstall/archive/helium-dev.tar.gz (change source when ready)
tar -xpf lithium-dev.tar.gz
cd bunsen-netinstall-lithium-dev
./install

The installation process will start.
Follow any prompts that appear on the screen.

A folder called bunsen-netinstall-logs will be added to your ~/.cache folder.
(The file bunsen-netinstall-logs/install.log will contain
verbose information about the install process.)
This folder may safely be removed if the installation was successful,
and no issues arose subsequently.

A folder /backup/bunsen-netinstall on your root file system will hold
backups of system files replaced during the install.

The script itself has been separated off from the files holding
specific data about the installation. This is intended to make
customization easier. It should not be necessary to edit "install".
Even if the script is upgraded in the future, the same config files
should still work.

DEBIAN NETINSTALL HINTS

Installing Debian Buster by the netinstall CD is
similar to using the standard installer.

Two points to watch if you want to use
this netinstall script afterwards:

1) At the "Set up users and passwords" screen,
do NOT enter a password for root.
Type nothing and press "continue".
Do this again at "Re-enter password to verify".
Enter your own name and password as normal.
You will then be given 'sudo' permissions,
which will be needed in the script.

2) At the "software selection" stage DESELECT EVERYTHING
except "standard system utilities".
You will have a core system only, on which
the netinstall installer will add what is needed.
(Some software items will be marked with an asterisk, indicating that
they have been preselected.
Use the up/down arrows to move, and the spacebar to toggle selection.)
